# py-prime-algorithms
This file contains a short summary of the project. 

## background


## file summaries 
- 100_mil_checked.txt contains all primes<100 million
- README.md is this file
- atkin.py contains the sieve of atkin which searches for all primes p<n
    - input: n
    - output: formatted array [number, isPrime, time]
- check_primes_legacy.py compares primes in file (in old format) to primes in 100_mil_checked.txt and prints results
    - input: filename (should contain path to file)
    - output: none
- check_primes.py compares primes in file (in new format) to primes in 100_mil_checked.txt and prints results
    - input: filename (should contain path to file)
    - output: none
